###### The next generation [NCBI PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)

### Ideas and prerequesities
Web databases and knowledge bases are the nowadays best tools to gain info and data to use in researching areas, data analyzis, to start any sort of scientific work, etc.

But with all the abillities they advice and all the features they have they bring plenty of ... places to make improvements in. Ancient UI/UX (especcialy UX that is so hard to get how to work with it) and not the best searching system - all of them are in the front row to be enhanced. One extra upgrade is should be a multylingual support, to make these tools be as easy to for any person as for English natives, since vast majority of such services have English user interface.

### About this tool
As was said in introduction, there was an idea to develop some next generation tool with the described improvements.

But we have a really wide variety of these tools, with different purposes, ideas and materials they can give. Since we weren't going to upgrade any of them, we stopped on fully opened articles database - [NCBI PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/).

In two words, we take articles outta there and pass them through our filters to define whether an article is original or review. Also, we give users some UI/UX improvements and russified interface.
